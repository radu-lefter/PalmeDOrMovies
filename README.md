# Palme D'Or Nominees REST API
## A Java Bootcamp final project

This project is the result of the final challenge from the QA DFE Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a REST API that can handle HTTP requests and that demonstrates CRUD functionality. The project was also built following Agile and MoSCoW practices. 


## Features

- Get a list of all the nominees 
- Add or update a nominee
- Delete a nominee
- Get winners or runner ups
- Get nominees for a certain year or above
- See the nominees as a json list or displayed in a front-end


## Tech


I used a number of open source projects to create the project:

- [Spring Boot] - Create a basic REST API in a day!
- [Thymeleaf] - As simple as installing the extension
- [Eclipse] - A lightweight but powerful editor
- [Swagger] - Generates an endpoint interface
- [Postman] - For testing more complex endpoints
- [Lombok] - Removes the clutter in your code
- [Mockito] - Makes testing more manageable
- [Plant UML] - Used to create the ERDs


## Installation

The API requires Spring Boot vs 2.7 and Java vs 18 to run. It can be executed from the command line with java -jar palmedor.jar.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

The project is stil in its first stages and needs to be enhanced. Contributions are welcome! More custom queries need to be added. The views for the app needs to be enhanced and the update and delete functionality for the fron-end need to be implemented. Tests need to be added to reach 100% coverage.
