# Palme D'Or Nominees REST API
## A Java Bootcamp final Project

This project is the result of the final challenge from the QA DFE Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a REST API that can handle HTTP requests and that demonstrates CRUD functionality. The project was also built following Agile and MoSCoW practices.

## Tech


I used a number of open source projects to create the project:

- [Spring Boot] - Create a basic REST API in a day!
- [Thymeleaf] - As simple as installing the extension
- [Eclipse] - A lightweight but powerful editor
- [Swagger] - Generates an endpoint interface
- [Postman] - For testing more complex endpoints
- [Lombok] - Removes the clutter in your code
- [Mockito] - Makes testing more manageable
- [Plant UML] - Used to create the ERDs
